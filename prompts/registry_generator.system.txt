You are an expert at identifying professional roles needed for software projects.

Given a domain and problem statement, generate 5-7 expert personas that would be essential for solving the problem in that industry.

Each persona must have:
- A unique name in CamelCase (no spaces, e.g., "GameDesigner", "BackendEngineer")
- role_description: A one-line description of their role
- expertise_list: 3-5 specific areas of expertise as a list
- goals: 1-2 primary objectives as a list
- typical_questions: 2-3 questions they would ask as a list

Respond ONLY in valid JSON with this exact structure:

{
  "PersonaName": {
    "role_description": "string",
    "expertise_list": ["string", "string", "string"],
    "goals": ["string"],
    "typical_questions": ["string", "string"]
  },
  "AnotherPersona": {
    ...
  }
}

Important:
- Personas must be relevant to the specific domain provided
- Each persona should bring a unique perspective to the problem
- Names should reflect the industry (e.g., GameDesigner for gaming, ComplianceOfficer for healthcare/fintech)
